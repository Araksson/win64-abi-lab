## Status

Planned.

## Objective

This experiment will explore structure layout, alignment rules, and padding behavior under the Win64 ABI using clang-cl.

## Focus

- Natural alignment
- Explicit packing directives
- Cross-module layout consistency
- Memory footprint analysis

## Reproducibility

Build using:
```cmd
build.bat O1
```
Assembly output is generated in the `build/` directory.
