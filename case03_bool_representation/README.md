# Case 03 — Boolean Representation

## Status

Planned.

## Objective

This experiment will investigate how boolean values are represented and propagated under the Win64 ABI.

## Areas of Interest

- Register representation
- Implicit conversions
- Cross-module boolean passing
- Optimization influence

## Reproducibility

Build with:
```cmd
build.bat O1
```
Generated assembly will be available in the `build/` directory.
